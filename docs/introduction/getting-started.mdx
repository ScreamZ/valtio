# Valtio

### Proxy state made simple.

The Valtio API is minimal, flexible, unopinionated and a touch magical. Valtio's proxy turns the object you pass it into a self-aware proxy, allowing fine-grained subscription and reactivity when making state updates. In React, Valtio shines at render optimization. It is compatible with Suspense and React 18. Valtio is also a viable option in vanilla javascript applications.

Valtio also work on desktop with NodeJS, Deno or Bun.

## Installation

Add the package with any dependencies manager you like in `dependencies`.

```bash
npm i valtio
```

```bash
pnpm add valtio
```

```bash
yarn add valtio
```

## Basic usage

Working with valtio is simple and straightforward. It's a small library with a simple API. A basic workflow with valtio is:

1. Create a state object with `proxy`.
2. Subscribe for changes with `subscribe` or some other methods like `subscribeKey`, `derived` or `watch`. When using react you rather use `useSnapshot` or `useProxy` which are optimized for React rendering.
3. You mutate the state object directly and subscribers will be notified.
