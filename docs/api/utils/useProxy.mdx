```tsx
/**
 * Takes a proxy and returns a new proxy which you can use in both react render
 * and in callbacks. The root reference is replaced on every render, but the
 * keys (and subkeys) below it are stable until they're intentionally mutated.
 * For the best ergonomics, you can export a custom hook from your store, so you
 * don't have to figure out a separate name for the hook reference. E.g.:
 *
 * @param proxy
 * @param options
 * @returns A new proxy which you can use in the render as well as in callbacks.

```tsx
// store.tsx
 export const store = proxy(initialState)
 export const useStore = () => useProxy(store)

 // SomeComponent.tsx
 const SomeComponent: React.FC = () => {
   const store = useStore()

   return <button onClick={() => { store.count++ }}>{store.count}</button>
 }
 ```
